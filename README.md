# Forecast Weatherapp Demo


### Preview
[Click here](https://vue-weather-forecast.herokuapp.com/

 
Install instructions:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/allenRoyston/weather-forecast-demo.git
$ cd weather-forecast-demo
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
- Browser should open automatically and will hot reload when making changes to components.  

Pre Deployment Instructions:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run builddev
$ npm run buildserver
$ npm start  
```

### Additional stuff
- When running npm run builddev or buildserver, sometimes webpack will respond with a minification.  Just ignore it; it seems to be a bug with the current version I have installed.
